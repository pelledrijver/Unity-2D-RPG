# Unity-2D-RPG
The game was developed in Unity with the C# programming language as a side-project in my 2019 summer break. I used TileMaps to create the maps with tiles downloaded from Kenney. 

The player is able move, attack, kill enemies, and talk to NPCs. All movements/attacks are animated and the camera follows the player between levels. I implemented a basic UI, a music manager, stats, item collecting, and created simple quests. Although I never finished building the game, I really enjoyed creating it and gained a lot of knowledge in object-oriented programming.
